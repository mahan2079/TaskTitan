# TaskTitan Integration Plan

## Overview
This plan outlines the steps to integrate the functionality from the original `TaskTitan.py` into the modern UI structure in the `TaskTitan/app` directory.

## Current Structure Analysis
- **Original File (`TaskTitan.py`)**: 
  - A monolithic PyQt5 application with all functionality in a single file
  - Uses SQLite database with tables for goals, tasks, habits, etc.
  - Contains UI components for calendar, weekly planner, daily planner, etc.
  
- **New Structure (`TaskTitan/app/`)**: 
  - Modern modular PyQt6-based architecture with MVC pattern
  - Separate files for models, views, and controllers
  - Improved UI with dashboard and sidebar-based navigation

## Integration Strategy

### 1. Core Functionality Migration

#### Database & Models
- [x] Database schemas already migrated to `app/models/database.py`
- [ ] Create model classes for each database entity (Goal, Task, Habit, etc.)
- [ ] Update database functions to use PyQt6 and modern syntax

#### Features to Integrate
- [ ] Goals Management
- [ ] Tasks Management
- [ ] Habits Tracking
- [ ] Weekly Planning
- [ ] Daily Planning
- [ ] Pomodoro Timer
- [ ] Productivity Tracking
- [ ] Visualization & Analytics

### 2. UI Improvements

- [ ] Maintain modern UI design already present in `app/views/main_window.py`
- [ ] Update each view component with functionality from `TaskTitan.py`:
  - [ ] Task Widget
  - [ ] Goal Widget
  - [ ] Habit Widget
  - [ ] Calendar Widget
  - [ ] Productivity View
  - [ ] Pomodoro Widget
  - [ ] Weekly View
  - [ ] Daily View

### 3. Implementation Steps

1. **Models & Database**
   - [ ] Create CRUD operations for each model
   - [ ] Add data validation and error handling

2. **Core Features**
   - [ ] Goals Management
     - [ ] Add, edit, delete goals
     - [ ] Handle parent-child relationships
     - [ ] Track completion status
   - [ ] Tasks Management
     - [ ] Add, edit, delete tasks
     - [ ] Associate tasks with goals
   - [ ] Habits Tracking
     - [ ] Add, edit, delete habits
     - [ ] Track habit completion
   - [ ] Weekly & Daily Planning
     - [ ] Weekly task view implementation
     - [ ] Daily planner implementation
     - [ ] Notes functionality
   - [ ] Pomodoro Timer
     - [ ] Timer functionality with work/break periods
     - [ ] Notifications and sound alerts
   - [ ] Productivity Analytics
     - [ ] Activity tracking
     - [ ] Time usage visualization
     - [ ] Progress reports

3. **Controllers Implementation**
   - [ ] Create controller classes for each feature
   - [ ] Implement business logic from `TaskTitan.py`
   - [ ] Add improved error handling and validation

4. **UI Integration**
   - [ ] Connect UI elements to controllers
   - [ ] Implement event handling
   - [ ] Ensure consistent theme and styling

5. **Testing & Refinement**
   - [ ] Test each feature individually
   - [ ] Integration testing
   - [ ] UI/UX improvements

### 4. Implementation Priority

1. Core data models and database operations
2. Basic task and goal management
3. Calendar and planning views
4. Habits tracking
5. Pomodoro and productivity features
6. Visualization and analytics
7. Theme customization
8. Export/import functionality

## Timeline Estimation

- **Phase 1**: Models & Database (1-2 days)
- **Phase 2**: Core Feature Implementation (3-5 days)
- **Phase 3**: UI Integration & Testing (2-3 days)
- **Phase 4**: Final Refinement (1-2 days)

Total estimated time: 7-12 days

## Additional Improvements

- Add user authentication
- Cloud sync capabilities
- Mobile companion app integration
- Improved data visualization
- AI-assisted planning
