# Daily View Implementation and Database Fix

## What I've Added

I've implemented a fully-functional daily view with the following features:

1. **Calendar Navigation**: Users can browse through dates using previous/next buttons and return to today
2. **Event Management**: 
   - Add, edit, delete and complete daily events
   - Events are time-stamped and categorized
   - Visual indicators show completion status
3. **Daily Notes**:
   - Added a notes tab where users can write and save daily notes
   - Notes are saved per date

## Database Issue

The application has a persistent database error with "no such column: week_start_date". To resolve this:

1. **Close VSCode/IDE completely**: Any open connections to the database may be preventing fixes
2. **Delete the database file**:
   - Find and delete `tasktitan.db` in your project directory
   - The file will be recreated with the correct schema when you start the app

3. **If that doesn't work**:
   - Open `TaskTitan/app/views/main_window.py`
   - Find the `loadStatistics` method (around line 637)
   - Replace the weekly progress query with this safer version that doesn't rely on week_start_date:

```python
# Weekly goal progress - use safer query
try:
    start_of_week = self.getStartOfWeek()
    end_of_week = datetime.fromisoformat(start_of_week).date() + timedelta(days=6)
    
    # Query tasks between start and end of week
    self.cursor.execute("""
        SELECT COUNT(*), SUM(completed)
        FROM weekly_tasks
        WHERE date BETWEEN ? AND ?
    """, (start_of_week, end_of_week.isoformat()))
    
    result = self.cursor.fetchone()
    if result and result[0] > 0:
        weekly_task_count = result[0]
        weekly_completed_count = result[1] or 0
        weekly_progress = int((weekly_completed_count / weekly_task_count) * 100)
        self.weekly_progress.setValue(weekly_progress)
    else:
        self.weekly_progress.setValue(0)
except (sqlite3.Error, ValueError) as e:
    print(f"Error loading weekly progress: {e}")
    self.weekly_progress.setValue(0)
```

## Using the Daily View

After fixing the database issue, you can access the daily view from the sidebar. The daily view allows you to:

- Navigate between dates
- Add events with specific times
- Mark events as complete
- Edit or delete events via right-click menu
- Add notes for each day

The implementation uses SQLite to store events and notes, with proper error handling to ensure stability.
